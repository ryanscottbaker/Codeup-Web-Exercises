				<span class="george">BY GEORGE HASKELL</span>

				<p class="paragraph">'Twas <em>brillig</em>, and the slithy toves<br>
				Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
				All <em>mimsy</em> were the borogoves,<br>
				And the moe raths outgrabe.

				<p class="paragraph2"><strong>"Beware the Jabberwock,</strong> my son!<br>
				The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
				Beware the JubJub bird, and shun<br>
				The fruminious Bandersnatch!"

				<p class="paragraph3">He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
				Long time the manzome foe he sought&mdash;<br>
				So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
				And stood awhile in thought.<br>
