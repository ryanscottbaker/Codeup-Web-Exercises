Should he leave?  More importantly, can Ryan even make these choices or is he under the command of unseen forces.  Is some stranger at a keyboard somehwere controlling every move.  In any case, it would take far too long to walk south or east across the clearing.  There's a forest to his north and a pond to his west.";
