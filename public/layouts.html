			The Death Star is a fictional mobile megastructure and galactic superweapon appearing in the Star Wars science-fiction franchise created by George Lucas. Crewed with an estimated population of 1.7 million military personnel and 400,000 droids,[1] this dwarf planet-sized fortress was designed with extremely powerful power projection capabilities, capable of destroying an entire planet with one blast from its superlaser.<p>
					Origin and design[edit]
			Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them.[2] The Death Star was created by the "dean of special effects", John Stears.[3][4] The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials.[5] Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi.[6] Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film.[6] Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.[2][6]</p>
